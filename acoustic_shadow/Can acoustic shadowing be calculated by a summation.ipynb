    "## What is 'shadow strength' ? \n",
    "Right now in the 'detailed sound propagation' I implement acoustic shadowing by calculating the effective reduction in sound pressure level only because of the object, and not because of spherical spreading. Eg. the bistatic target strength of the sphere I measured at 180$^{\\circ}$ separation was -9 dB. This is including the spherical spreading of -6 dB from source to receiver. Therefore the effective 'shadow strenght' of the object is -3 dB. \n",
